/**
 * Key Insight: Since the number of stars is large- one trillion.
 * Finding the kth elment will require a data structure that would use less space (i.e. k-space).
 * A heap comes to mind. Would it be a max heap or a min heap?
 * Well, since we are looking for the k closet (i.e. shortest distance from the earth) stars,
 * then we need to evict any star that has the largest distance from Earth from a candidate set of stars. Hence, max heap will be ideal.
 * Algorithm: Keeping adding stars to the heap until heap size is greater than k. Then evict the largest entry in the heap.
 ** Note that the result is a sorted (from largest to smallest) set of distance.
 ** This result can be returned as is or sorted to get the reverse of  the sorted set.
